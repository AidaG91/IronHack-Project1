This is AÃ¯da behind the screen! ðŸ‘‹

I started learning programming about a month ago (to be precise, on June 4th) because Iâ€™m seeking a change in my career path. I come from English Studies, Translation and Audiovisual Localization, with a PM background. 
This project is part of the IronHack bootcamp, for which Iâ€™ve built a website for a fictional web design company called Circle Agency.
